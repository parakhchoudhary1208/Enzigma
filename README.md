# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules for code quality and consistency.

## Official Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available to enhance your React development experience with Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to enable Fast Refresh and various JSX/React transformations.
  
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This alternative plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, providing a faster compilation experience compared to Babel.

## Key Features

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: This allows you to see changes in real time without refreshing the entire page, making development faster and smoother.
  
- **ESLint Support**: Basic ESLint rules are included for linting your code and maintaining code quality. You can customize the `.eslintrc` file according to your project's needs.

- **Vite's Development Speed**: Vite is designed for fast and efficient development, with lightning-fast startup and hot-reload times.

## Installation

To get started with the template:

1. Clone the repository or create a new project with the template:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parakhchoudhary1208/enzigma.git

2. Install Dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install

3. Run Developement Server
    ```bash
    npm run dev


- **Note**: You can modify the ESLint rules by editing the .eslintrc file in the root directory. This helps maintain consistent code formatting and catching potential issues early.
